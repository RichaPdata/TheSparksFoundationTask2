## Task 2: Prediction Using Un-Supervised Machine Learning: From the given Iris Dataset, Predict the Optimum number of Clusters &amp; represent it Visually.

Hello everyone,
This is my 2nd task as a Data Science & Business Analytics Intern with The Sparks Foundation under 
hashtag
#GRIPNOVEMBER23 batch.

Task Objective: Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters & represent it visually. We'll be using K-Means Clustering Algorithm. K-Means is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabelled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only one group that has similar properties. Workflow:
1. Select number K to decide the number of clusters.
2. Select random K points or centroids (can be other than input dataset).
3. Assign each data point to their closest centroid, forming the predefined K clusters.
4. Calculate variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.
5. Repeat 3rd steps, which means reassign each datapoint to new closest centroid of each cluster.
6. If any reassignment occurs, go to (4) else go to FINISH.
7. The model is ready.
